</p>

Morpheus is a file-based malware scanner built to detect a wide range of malicious artifacts across several critical stages of the Cyber Kill Chain. Using a robust YARA rule set, Morpheus systematically analyzes files to uncover traces of attack strategies, ensuring that even sophisticated, staged attacks are identified:

- **Reconnaissance:** Detecting evidence of preparatory steps embedded in files that may signal information-gathering activities by attackers.
- **Exploitation:** Identifying patterns in files indicating attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities, utilizing custom YARA rules for specificity.
- **Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation:** Recognizing malware signatures indicative of privilege escalation scripts or code fragments designed for network propagation.
- **Obfuscation & Anti-Forensics:** Catching malware files attempting to disguise their presence or eliminate forensic traces, signaling an effort to evade detection.
- **Exfiltration:** Monitoring for files or embedded data configured to exfiltrate sensitive information from the target system.

### Sophistication lies in this tool:

Furthermore, Morpheus is equipped with advanced APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) detection, allowing it to catch even the most sophisticated attacks in real time. If the YARA ruleset isn‚Äôt enough, Morpheus seamlessly integrates with VirusTotal, one of the world‚Äôs leading platforms for malware analysis, widely trusted by security professionals. Rest easy knowing Morpheus has you covered.

Morpheus‚Äôs goal is to comprehensively address threats throughout every phase of the attack lifecycle, defend like there is no tomorrow.

## Modes of Operation

1. **VirusTotal Scan (API Key Required)**  
   Submit a file or hash to VirusTotal for an in-depth analysis using multiple antivirus engines. This mode provides comprehensive information about potential threats using VirusTotal's extensive database.

  Provides detailed output, including insights from security vendors, community feedback, and more. Limitations include API rate limiting (though the default limit is relatively high) and no results for files that haven't been previously analyzed in the VirusTotal database.

2. **Default Scan (YARA)**  
   Perform a static scan using YARA rules and Pefile to identify common malicious patterns. This method can quickly flag suspicious files, including the custom detection of **KRYPT0S**, a ransomware developed by me as a proof of concept (POC).
   
  Provides enhanced features compared to the "VirusTotal Scan" option, including PDF output, AI integration, and access to an extensive signature database capable of detecting files not registered with VirusTotal. However, it may be prone to instability due to heavy dependencies and pre-setup requirements. While Morpheus undergoes rigorous testing, results may vary depending on the system.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with **Morpheus IOC Scanner**, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```
 2. Set up the YARA database: Morpheus comes with a basic, default YARA rule database, so you can start scanning files right away. However, for a more extensive rule set to capture a broader range of malware, run the setup file:
    ```python
    python3 setup.py
    ```
*Note: Running setup.py requires Git to install additional rules. If Git isn‚Äôt installed, Morpheus will attempt to install it for you, though it's recommended to have Git pre-installed to avoid potential errors.*

3. Once setup is complete, you can run the main file:
    ```python
    python3 morpheus_scanner.py
    ```

</p>

## Updating the YARA Database

Periodically run the `database_updater.py` script to fetch the latest YARA rules and ensure your database is up-to-date with the latest versions from the GitHub repositories.

```bash
python3 database_updater.py
```

If you wish to switch to a more comprehensive or lighter YARA ruleset, such as the Fortress Edition or Nano Edition, simply run the `setup.py` script again. This will handle the deletion of old files and automatically set up the new ruleset for you.

Running the setup script will seamlessly update the database and ensure you are using the desired edition of Morpheus.

## Common Issues Documented

Below are error messages that can be outputted from Morpheus:
1. Directory Error : ```[-] Ensure you're in the '/Main Files' Morpheus directory before continuing! Program Aborted.```
   
    The error above indicates that Morpheus is not being run from its "Main Files" folder. This folder serves as the primary directory for Morpheus. Running the program from any other directory will trigger this error because Morpheus relies on dynamic path extraction relative to the current working directory. If executed from a different directory, file paths will become invalid. To resolve this, ensure you run Morpheus from the "morpheus_IOC_scanner/Main Files" directory.

3. Git Error : ```Git may not have been installed correctly, the program is unable to access the command. This may be due to a system error during installation.```
   
   This is primarily a Windows-specific error that occurs when Git is not installed. Morpheus attempts to install Git using "winget" (a Windows package manager). While this usually succeeds, the terminal may need to be restarted for the environmental variables associated with Git to take effect. If this error appears, restart the terminal and re-run Morpheus. If the issue persists, manually install Git from its official website to resolve the problem.

5. Libyara.so Error : ```Libyara not found in your 'Yara' installation. Please try uninstall all python dependencies and re-install them.```
   
   This is a known and persistent issue with the "yara" library in Python. It occurs when a required shared object is missing during the installation of "yara." This problem is commonly observed on both Windows and Linux systems and has been widely documented across various forums and resources. Below are some steps to help mitigate this error:
   - Purge all YARA libraries and files from the system, then attempt a re-installation to ensure any missing files are properly restored
   - If on Linux, try run this command : ```sudo apt-get install libyara-dev``` for Ubuntu/Debian or ```sudo dnf install yara-devel``` if on Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora, then re-run the tool
   - If on Linux try rebuild the local library : First run ```sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf``` then run ```sudo ldconfig```, then re-run the tool

   If the issue persists, you can refer to a thread where the problem is discussed in detail, including alternative methods shared by others who managed to resolve it. Link to thread can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41255478/issue-oserror-usr-lib-libyara-so-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-fi).
