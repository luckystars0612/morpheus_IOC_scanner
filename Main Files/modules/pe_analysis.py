PE Analysis Logic
Author: Phantom0004 (Daryl Gatt)

Description:
This section handles the analysis of Portable Executable (PE) files using a dedicated PE analysis library. 
It provides more precise and detailed inspection of PE structures, making it more suitable than YARA for in-depth PE analysis.

Usage:
This logic focuses on extracting detailed information from PE files, including headers, sections, imports, and other attributes, 
to complement or go beyond what YARA pattern matching can achieve.
